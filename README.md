# Autoimmune Antigen Features and Classification

**Start here:** [get_data.py](get_data.py)


## Background

Autoimmunity is the process whereby a host's immune system initiates 
an immune response against it's own cells and tissues. The adaptive
immune system reacts with a self-protein via antibodies or T cells 
leading to host damage. This project attempts to explore and find
features/traits of these self-proteins (or autoimmune antigens). 

### GOALS
1. Extract and validate autoimmune antigen data from the [IEDB](https://www.iedb.org/). **DONE**
2. Explore and identify features of autoimmune antigens. **IN PROGRESS**
3. Build a model for autoimmune antigen prediction.
